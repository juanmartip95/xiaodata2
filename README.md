# xiaodata2
Description
This code script is designed to perform various data analysis tasks on a dataset, including data visualization, linear regression, piecewise linear fitting, and generating comparative metrics.

Content Overview
Dataset Loading and Preprocessing

Reads a dataset file (xiao_data) and performs data cleaning and numeric conversion on specified columns.
Generates plots depicting the original dataset and a subset starting from the minimum value in the "Oxygen 1" column.
Piecewise Linear Fitting

Utilizes the pwlf library to perform piecewise linear fitting on a specified subset of the dataset.
Plots the original data and the fitted piecewise linear functions.
Calculates and displays breakpoints and comparison metrics between Linear Regression and Piecewise Linear Fit.
Requirements
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
pwlf
prettytable
Execution Steps
Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
Perform data visualization and analysis using various libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and pwlf.
Display comparison metrics between linear regression and piecewise linear fitting using the prettytable library.
Usage
Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Run each code cell sequentially to perform different tasks.
Observe visualizations and printed metrics in the output.
Notes
Adjust the parameters such as the number of segments in the piecewise linear fit by modifying the num_segments variable.
Replace xiao_filepath with the appropriate file path if necessary.
Modify the column names in the dataset according to your specific dataset structure.
